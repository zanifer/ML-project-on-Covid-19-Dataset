## Machine Learning project on Covid-19 dataset

This is a machine learning project that analyzes the Covid-19 dataset to predict whether a patient recovered or not based on various features. The goal of this project is to build and compare several machine learning models to find the most accurate one.

## Dataset
The Covid-19 dataset is a public dataset that contains information about patients infected with Covid-19, including their demographic information, symptoms, medical history, and more. It has thousands of rows and dozens of columns, and it can be found on [Kaggle](https://www.kaggle.com/).

## Used Models
Several machine learning models have been implemented in this project:

- Logistic Regression
- Decision Tree Classifier
- Random Forest Classifier
- K-Nearest Neighbors Classifier

## Requirements
The following Python packages are required to run this project:
- Pandas
- numpy
- Matplotlib
- Seaborn
- Scikit-learn

## Usage
To run this project, you can follow these steps:

```bash
  Clone this repository to your local machine.
```
```bash
  Install the required packages using pip: pip install -r requirements.txt
```
```bash
  Open the main.ipynb notebook and run the cells to train and evaluate the models.
```
```bash
  Optionally, you can modify the notebook to experiment with different features or models.
```

## Results
The results of this project shows accuracy for different models.

## Conclusion
In this project, I analyzed the Covid-19 dataset and built several machine learning models to predict whether a patient recovered or not. This project demonstrates the importance of feature engineering and model selection in machine learning, and it has potential applications in predicting Covid-19 recovery rates.
